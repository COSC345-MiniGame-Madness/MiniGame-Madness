# **Project Overview**

Our project, titled "Minigame Madness," focuses on creating a collection of mini-games, each implemented as a simple command-line application. The essence of our project lies in its minimalist design, utilising ASCII art for the user interface while maintaining the core functionality of the original games. The aim is to recreate classic games like Tetris and Battleships, adhering to the 'back to basics' theme by stripping down the design to its most fundamental elements.

# **Project process/goals**

1. ### Menu System

   * Develop a main menu that hosts all our mini-games.  
   * Allow users to select and play any game from the menu.  
   * Implement a scoring system for each game and display scoreboards.

2. ### Game Development Process

   * Each team member will work on multiple simple games and some moderate games in parallel.  
   * Collaboratively tackle the more challenging games as a team.  
   * For each game, start by defining the requirements, followed by method implementation, and thorough testing.  
   * Assemble and test all methods to ensure seamless integration.  
   * Repeat the development process for each game until all are completed.

# **Uniqueness and Niche**

Although the games we are recreating are not unique, there is a lack of widely-known applications that feature a launcher for multiple command-line games. A similar project to ours would be [BSD Games](https://github.com/vattam/BSDGames), which consists of classic board/arcade games as well as some unique games. But lacks a central launcher and menu system. 

Our project aims to fill this niche by offering a diverse range of classic games in one application. We recognize potential copyright issues if this project were to be widely distributed, so it is primarily for educational purposes.

# **Justification**

There are often periods of downtime for coders while waiting for programs to compile or run. Instead of watching YouTube or idly waiting, our application provides a fun and nostalgic way to pass the time. Users can easily open another terminal and play their favourite childhood games, all within the command line.

# **Technical overview**

Our language of choice is going to be C++ we chose this as no one in our team had any real experience in C or C++ and C++ seemed a bit easier to handle. We have decided to use VS Code as our IDE of choice as it has good Git integrations and is easy to use. Jayben has created a Web server version of VS code which allows us all to work on the same file at the same time if we are all working remotely ([https://code.jaybentohill.com](https://code.jaybentohill.com) it’s password-locked) this allows us to in real time see what each other is coding but it’s running Linux we have to make sure what we code on that and compile and run on windows afterwards.

Our Goal for the Main menu graphics and the game graphics is to have clean ASCII art for each this is to keep with our back to basics theme. The art should be simple but good at conveying what is going on in the game. Our main menu should be clean and able to pick from any of our games. If we have multiple pages we will be able to move across easily. Our games will be coded on an individual basis with the main goal being more parallelised work, but we will come back together for harder games we will also group our games so that 1 person will get similar games so they can reuse their code, for example, connect 4 and naughts and crosses. 

# **Project Management**

To effectively plan our project, we will use a Gantt chart. This chart helps us plot the development stages of each game, including alpha, beta, and release phases, and assign tasks to each group member. We have also transferred the tasks in the Gantt chart into issues in our git repository which are then managed in a GitHub Project. This integration of GitHub Projects into our repository enables team members to monitor the real-time progress of their peers, ensuring better coordination and transparency throughout the project.

# **Risk Management Strategies**

To manage risks effectively, our first step was to identify potential risks by brainstorming sessions as a group. We discussed the various challenges our project might encounter and considered possible mitigation strategies for each. This gave us a good idea of the risks to our project and group.

We then estimated the cost in hours that each identified risk could potentially incur and assessed the likelihood of these risks based on our collective judgment. For example, we determined that there is a high chance (80%) of a team member falling ill, with a low cost of 5 hours. Our mitigation strategy for this risk was to allocate extra time throughout the semester to compensate for any lost productivity. As a result, the adjusted impact was reduced to 2 hours, yielding a risk reduction leverage of 3.4.

This systematic approach was applied to all the risks we identified, ensuring that we have a clear plan to address each one. Our comprehensive risk management document is available here for detailed information.

# **Conclusion:**

"Minigame Madness" isn't just another project; it's a fun dive into the simplicity of command-line interfaces and classic gaming. We're stripping games down to their core, using ASCII art to keep things visually engaging yet minimalistic. 

Each of us brings something unique to the table. Christopher's creativity and game design, Jayben's system skills and report writing, and Angus's project management and terminal enthusiasm all come together to make a strong team. Even though none of us are pros at C++, we're excited to learn and grow through this project. 

We're set up for effective collaboration using C++ and VS Code, along with a shared web server, even when working remotely. Our goal is to recreate classics like Tetris and Battleships in a way that’s easy to play and nostalgic. This gives coders a fun way to kill time during those inevitable waits while code compiles.

 "Minigame Madness'' is about merging simple design with enjoyable gameplay. It’s a project that showcases our skills, creativity, and passion for coding and game development, while also giving us a great learning experience.
