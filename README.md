# MiniGame-Madness
## Project Overview
Our project, titled "Back to Basics," focuses on creating a collection of mini-games, each implemented as a simple command-line application. The essence of our project lies in its minimalist design, utilising ASCII art for the user interface while maintaining the core functionality of the original games. The aim is to recreate classic games like Tetris and Battleships, adhering to the 'back to basics' theme by stripping down the design to its most fundamental elements.
## Project process/goals
### Menu System
Develop a main menu that hosts all our mini-games.
Allow users to select and play any game from the menu.
Implement a scoring system for each game and display scoreboards.
### Game Development Process
Each team member will work on multiple simple games and some moderate games in parallel.
Collaboratively tackle the more challenging games as a team.
For each game, start by defining the requirements, followed by method implementation, and thorough testing.
Assemble and test all methods to ensure seamless integration.
Repeat the development process for each game until all are completed.
